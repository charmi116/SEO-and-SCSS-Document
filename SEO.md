When you search any keyword using a search engine, it displays thousands of results found in its database. A page ranking is measured by the position of web pages displayed in the search engine results. If a search engine is putting your web page on the first position, then your web page rank will be number 1 and it will be assumed as the page with the highest rank.

SEO is the process of designing and developing a website to attain a high rank in search engine results.

#### 1. Make your website’s structure clear, intuitive and up-to-date.
Search engines go through a link structure to find and index pages. If your site is structured well, all the pages and subpages will be easily found and indexed by search engine crawlers.

#### 2. Include one primary keyword in a page URL.
The web pages in your domain may be optimized for many different keywords. It is said that the best way is to focus only on one keyword phrase and to include it directly in the URL address.Use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_) in URLs.

#### 3. Use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_) in URLs.
When you use underscores to separate words in a URL name, Google will read it as one single word. This means that the_best_seo_practices will be treated by search crawlers as ‘thebestseopractices’.

#### 4. Choose a static URL address instead of a dynamic one.
There are two types of web addresses: static and dynamic.

A static URL looks like that:
your-domain-name.com/category/the-best-seo-practices

A dynamic one can look like this:
your-domain-name.com/category/?p=028705

While search engines can easily understand both of the URLs, for human beings dynamic URLs are completely illegible.

#### 5. Keep a URL address brief, descriptive and relevant.
A visitor should be able to tell at a glance what a particular website is all about. If you choose to edit a URL address yourself, you’ll not only work in favor of the keyword optimization, but you’ll also make it easier for a user to understand what he or she can find on a particular website. This way you’ll make a searcher’s life a bit easier.

#### 6. Create a sweet title-tag for every single page of your website.
This is the one place on a webpage where your keywords MUST be present. Correct use of keywords in the title of every page of your website is extremely important to Google - particularly for the homepage. If you do nothing else to optimize your site, remember to do this!

#### 7. Use meta-description to present your brand better.
A meta description is a short paragraph which is displayed under a title tag on the SERP (see screen above). A meta-description gives you the opportunity to introduce your brand before a searcher pays a visit to your site and actually sees the products that you offer.

The optimal length of a meta-description is between 150-160 characters.

#### 8. Don’t forget to use ALT attributes for all of the images.
Search engines don’t read images, they read the ALT text instead. You should use an ALT attribute to help engine crawlers better understand the meaning of an image and what it represents. Of course, it’s good to use keyword phrases you target to describe the images on the web page itself.

#### 9. Find keywords that will work for you.
A keyword is a term that is used to match with the query a person enters into a search engine to find specific information. Most people enter search phrases that consist of two to five words. Such phrases may be called search phrases, keyword phrases, query phrases, or just keywords. Good keyword phrases are specific and descriptive.
The following concepts related to keywords, help in optimizing the keywords on a web page.

##### Best Places to Put Keywords
Here is a list of places where you should try to use your main keywords.

* Keywords in the `<title>` tag(s).
* Keywords in the `<meta name="description">`.
* Keywords in the `<meta name="keyword">`.
* Keywords in` <h1>` or other headline tags.
* Keywords in the `<a href="http://yourcompany.com">`keywords`</a>` link tags.
* Keywords in the body copy.
* Keywords in alt tags.
* Keywords in <!-- insert comments here> comments tags.
* Keywords in the URL or website address.

##### Finding Keywords
There are many different ways to find keywords for your website. Some good keyword ideas are:

* The potential words, people would use to find your product or service.
* The problems that your prospective customers may try to solve with your product or service.
* Keyword tags on competitor's websites.
* Visible page copy on competitor's websites.
* Related search suggestions on top search engines.
* Using an online tool such as `Google Keyword Tool`
* By analyzing your website carefully and finding out proper keywords. This task can be done by expert SEO copywriters.
* Pay attention to stemming for your keywords - particularly to what the root word is and what Google considers to be a match for that word, when optimizing pages over time.
* You can do brainstorming to identify correct keywords for your site.

#### 10. Place your keywords in headlines, subheadings and anchor texts.
Not every spot on your website will give your keyword phrases the same exposure and SEO power. In a content’s structure the best places to put your keywords are headlines, subheadings, bolded sections within a text and anchor texts (copy that describes links).

When describing links don’t ever use the “click here” term! It gives absolutely no information about what can be found under a particular link, plus you miss the chance to optimize a text link.

#### 11. Optimize all images with proper keywords.
Don’t forget to use keyword phrases not only throughout the website’s content, but also in the image description. It is also believed that it’s good practice to use words such as: “image”, “photo”, “picture” along with your picked keyword while `describing an image with an ALT attribute`.

#### 12. Publish only high quality, fresh and keyword rich content.
One of the most important SEO factors nowadays is a website’s content. If you provide useful and actionable information for users, search engines will rank your website higher in SERPs. To get the best optimization results, you should also update your content as often as it is possible. This way you’ll keep your website fresh and your audience interested.

#### 13. Pay special attention to spelling and grammar of your content.
High-quality content means faultless spelling. It’s true that people often misspell words they type into search bars. Some the of not-so-recommended techniques advise to optimize a website also for misspelled keywords so that users who are not good at grammar could easily find it. However, excessive misspellings and poor grammar can only harm your website’s rankings.

#### 14. Make your content easy to read.
On the Internet, people tend to scan text rather than read it from cover to cover. That’s why you should provide a clear structure of each piece of content. Use headlines, subheadings, bullets and bolds in the most relevant sections of your copy.

Also, try to – use pictures, real-life examples, infographics or videos to illustrate information better and make your content memorable. Also don’t forget to place proper keywords throughout the content.

#### 15. Find out what your competition is doing for SEO.
Always keep an eye on your competitors. Find out what keywords they optimize their websites for and monitor their rankings along with yours. Do it on a daily basis. Check what websites they appear on and what content they publish on their blog.

You should know all of those not to copy their SEO strategy, but on the contrary, to find your own unique way of optimizing your website. Also, don’t be afraid to change the strategy as soon as you know that it fails to bring you good, sustainable results.
